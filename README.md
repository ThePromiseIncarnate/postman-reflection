## Exploring the Weather API

![Failed Attempt At Weather API](img/weatherFailure.png)

I got a status code of 200, meaning that everything was okay, but I used the wrong link, so instead of GETting the data for the city I was looking for, it gave me the HTML of the page.

Oops.

![Shreveport Weather](img/weatherShreveport.png)

http://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/current?key=4d8e0d0606654f008fbd84ed49c7604f&city=Shreveport,Louisiana

I got another status code of 200, meaning that everything was okay. The current temperature in Shreveport, Lousisiana as of this GET request is 34.2 Â°C, the weather description says "overcast clouds", and this city is in the American/Chicago timezone.
