## Exploring the Weather API

![Failed Attempt At Weather API](img/weatherFailure.png)

I got a status code of 200, meaning that everything was okay, but I used the wrong link, so instead of GETting the data for the city I was looking for, it gave me the HTML of the page.

Oops.

![Shreveport Weather](img/weatherShreveport.png)

http://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/current?key=4d8e0d0606654f008fbd84ed49c7604f&city=Shreveport,Louisiana

I got another status code of 200, meaning that everything was okay. The current temperature in Shreveport, Lousisiana as of this GET request is 34.2 Â°C, the weather description says "overcast clouds", and this city is in the American/Chicago timezone. 

## Interacting with GitHub's API

![GET Request](img/gitHubAPIGETRequest.png)

1. Go to the Settings of your GitHub account.
2. Scroll down until you see "Developer settings" and click that.
3. Click on "Personal access tokens", then "Fine-grained tokens".
4. Click the "Generate new token" button.
5. Give your token a name, set the "Repository access" to "All repositories", then set the "Repository permissions" for "Administration" and "Contents" to "read and write".
6. Copy the token - WARNING: be sure to paste it in a secure document somewhere so that you can have easy access to it after this. If you lose it and don't have this page open anymore, you'll have to make a new token.
7. Go to Postman and create a workspace. Once you've set up your workspace, paste your token in the Authorization section as a Bearer Key then Send a GET request on "https://api.github.com/user".

![POST Request](img/gitHubAPIPOSTRequest.png)

1. Do all the above steps, but change the request type from GET to POST. 
2. Go to Body, set it to "raw", then type this in: `{"name": "name of your repo"}`
3. When you click "Send" and check your Repositories on your account, a new Repo should have been created by Postman.
